This is a repository for a competition.
In this era where technology is evolving rapidly, an aging society is nothing more strange. When we are enjoying the convenience brought by technology, we do not know that these elders are still worried about how to use the technology of the previous generation. Due to the decline of learning ability and memory for elders, it is even more difficult for them to learn and use the latest technological products. Therefore, we hope to design a system that can improve the use of technological products by the elders. This system will include various shortcuts for collecting data and can effectively improve, simplify the use of technology for elders, in order to achieve a simple and effective Elderly life. This work will be presented in the form of windowed software, and use Python with various modules supported to achieve various commands and needs, helping the elders to use technology devices or software more conveniently.
